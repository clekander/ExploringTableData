    "Housing prices are a large topic of interest for many people around the world. A person's home and environment can greatly affect their life and mental state. Being able to predict housing costs could help buyers and sellers in the housing market as people looking to buy a house could use this model to see what factors drive prices up and be able to stay in their price range and sellers could get an accurate estimate of how much their home is worth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset is centered around housing in neighborhoods around Melbourne, Australia. This data was collected from public records posted on Domain.com.au, and the prediction task associated with this dataset is the price of the housing. This dataset has 13580 entries with 21 attributes for each observation. We found this dataset at kaggle.com. \n",
    "\n",
    "With our visualizations and analysis, we are able to show the most important factors in determining the price of a house and eventually will be able to predict the price based on these factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that the accuracy of our model would need to be a high percentage to be accepted by users because there are many algorithms about predicting housing prices that currently exist with high accuracy. When looking online, we found multiple tools built to forecast prices of homes (ex. VeroFORECAST) and research papers about machine learning for predicitng housing costs (ex. one we found claims 86% accuracy). \n",
